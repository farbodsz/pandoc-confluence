## Motivation

Writing documentation in Confluence can be a slow and painful process. It would
be nice if we could simply use a Markdown file to upload to Confluence.

Confluence stores data primarily using a custom XHTML-based storage format, and
pages can be created/updated/deleted using the
[Confluence REST API](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/rest/v1/intro/#status-code).

Writing XHTML by hand is obviously impractical, but writing Markdown is fun.
With a way to convert from Markdown to Confluence's XHTML, we would be able to
develop another process to publish the output file to a Confluence page.

### Setting up development environment

If you don't already have Haskell installed, the best way to install it is via
[GHCup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/).

### Testing

To run the end-to-end tests, you need to install the following dependencies:

```sh
$ npm i -g html-minifier
```

Run tests via `make`:

```sh
$ make test         # run end-to-end tests
$ make doctest      # test examples in doc comments
$ make test-all     # run all tests
```
