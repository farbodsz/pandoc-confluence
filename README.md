## Motivation

Writing documentation in Confluence can be a slow and painful process. It would
be nice if we could simply use a Markdown file to upload to Confluence.

Confluence stores data primarily using a custom XHTML-based storage format, and
pages can be created/updated/deleted using the
[Confluence REST API](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/rest/v1/intro/#status-code).

Writing XHTML by hand is obviously impractical, but writing Markdown is fun.
With a way to convert from Markdown to Confluence's XHTML, we would be able to
develop another process to publish the output file to a Confluence page.

## Features

### Supported

- Inline text formatting
- Confluence macro syntax, to render anything supported in Confluence wiki such
